This error typically occurs when using Expo's `react-native-web` integration. The specific cause is often related to misconfigurations within the web project's setup, particularly when it conflicts with how Expo manages the build process for web platforms. This might involve issues with the `webpack` configuration, incorrect paths, or missing dependencies that are essential for `react-native-web` to function properly.  Sometimes, it can also manifest as a consequence of using third-party libraries that aren't fully compatible with the Expo web environment, leading to unforeseen conflicts or incorrect bundling.   The actual error message could range from general `webpack` errors to more specific issues around the handling of JavaScript modules in a web context.
